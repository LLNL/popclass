Population model data format
----------------------------

In this section we will cover how simulation data from a population model
is saved. You might find this useful if you are planning on creating your
own population model and contributing it to popclass.

popclass models can be saved in the ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format). 
This Python implementation of the ASDF Standard can be found 
`here <https://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and more information 
on the ASDF Standard itself can be found 
`here <https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.1/>`_  
and in :cite:`Greenfield2015`.

Here is an example schema of a popclass model file 
'popsycle_singles_raithel18.asdf'

.. code::

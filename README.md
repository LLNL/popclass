popclass is a python package that allows flexible, probabilistic classification of
the lens of a microlensing event given the event's posterior distribution and a model of
the Galaxy. popclass provides the bridge between Galactic simulation and lens classification,
an interface to common Bayesian inference libraries, and the ability for users to flexibly
specify their own Galactic model and classification parameters.

For more details on the project please including the installation, contributing, and the getting started guide see the [documentation](https://popclass.readthedocs.io).

Example of popclass classifying a microlensing event with a range of different posterior distributions. Left panel shows a population simulation used to classify the event. Right panel shows the output lens classification from popclass which is calculated by combining the event posterior information with the simulation.
